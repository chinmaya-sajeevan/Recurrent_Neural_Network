# Recurrent_Neural_Network
Character-Level Text Generation using RNN and LSTM built with TensorFlow &amp; Keras. The model learns patterns from the text “hellohellohello” and predicts the next character using Embedding, sequence modeling, and softmax output. Includes training visualization and comparison between SimpleRNN and LSTM.
